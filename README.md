# MobileValidatorV1

**Mobile Number Validator V.1**

This is a basic and simple web application made using Node.js, React, Express and mongoose(MongoDB) and of course using an API.

The main goal for this web application is to register the customer infromations once he uses the webpage, such as first name and last name and location and store them into a database in the MongoDB .

Validate the mobile number of the customer he entered, once it's valid it will promot information about the mobile number such as, Country Code, Country name, Carrier name.

Added an Admin Panel for the admin to log in the panel and edit the information of the customer that was stored in the MongoDB via the Admin Panel, but the admin has to go through a sign up session in order to log in as an admin, when the admin is in, he can add, get and delete and also update information of any customer from the panel.

Added an email box where the customer can write his email and write a message for the admin about anything related to the site.
